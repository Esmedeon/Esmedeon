# Welcome to my profile
## About myself
Hello everybody, my name is Esmedeon. A name wich developed over the years during my use of forums and many online gaming sessions. 
After a while it stuck and carried over as my online alias. My real name is Uwe Schneider and am trying to get all the ideas, that float around in my head
and all the inspirations out of everyday situations bundled somewhere and maybe, with time into hopefully many useful projects.

## Interests
My interests are quite widespread and of course not every one of those receive the same focus, the day has only 24 hours after all. 
Anyways, here we go with a short list:
- 3D Artwork
- Programming ( one of those topics that can't get enough time but for which I have way to many ideas to be healty )
- Online Gaming ( one of the topics I really would like to program for one of these days. The topics for games seem a bit onesided these days but that might just be me )
- Game Modding ( grown out of the 'Online Gaming' interest in combination with my personal tastes in games. The game I am currently modding for myself is 7 Day to Die )
- Photography ( finally something 'offline' )
- Cooking / baking and everything around it. Sounds strange regarding the previously listed interests but one has to get away from the keyboard from time to time and what better motivation for it than nutrition.

## Curtrent learning activities
Well, there are quite a few these days. Since I am settling into my new job as future DevOps Engineer there are some new topics on the plate:
- Git / GitHub
- Ci/CD
- Python & Go
- Ansible & Terraform
- quite a few others...
